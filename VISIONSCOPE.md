### 1.5 Framt칤칧ars칳n
**For** employees **who** want to order meals from the company cafeteria or from local restaurants on-line, **the Cafeteria Ordering System**
**is** an Internet-based and smartphone-enabled application **that** will accept individual or group meal orders, process payments, 
and trigger delivery of the prepared meals to a designated location on the Process Impact campus. 
**Unlike** the current telephone and manual ordering processes, employees who use **the Cafeteria Ordering System** will not 
have to go to the cafeteria to get their meals, which will save them time and will increase the food choices available to them.

[ Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that are actively involved in a project, are affected by its outcome, or can influence its outcome. The stakeholder profiles identify the customers for this product and other stakeholders, and states their major interests in the product. Characterize business-level customers, target market segments, and different user classes, to reduce the likelihood of unexpected requirements surfacing later that cannot be accommodated because of schedule or scope constraints.

Examples of stakeholder value include:

- improved productivity
- reduced rework 
- cost savings	
- streamlined business processes	
- automation of previously manual tasks	
- ability to perform entirely new tasks or functions	
- conformance to current standards or regulations	
- improved usability or reduced frustration level compared to current applications
