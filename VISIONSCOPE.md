**For** employees **who** want to order meals from the company cafeteria or from local restaurants on-line, **the Cafeteria Ordering System**
**is** an Internet-based and smartphone-enabled application **that** will accept individual or group meal orders, process payments, 
and trigger delivery of the prepared meals to a designated location on the Process Impact campus. 
**Unlike** the current telephone and manual ordering processes, employees who use **the Cafeteria Ordering System** will not 
have to go to the cafeteria to get their meals, which will save them time and will increase the food choices available to them.
